# TypeScript Lab 2

## Instructions

Create your own directory structure and configure your `tsconfig.json`
accordingly to make sure that:

1. Any new `.ts` files you create gets compiled into a `.js` file when you call
   `tsc` without any parameters
2. Your `.js` files are generated in a directory that is separate from your
   `.ts` files

Fork the repo, create your directory structure, and then push the changes.
